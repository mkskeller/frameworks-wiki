## What is it?

JIFF (JavaScript Implementation of Federated Functionalities) is an MPC library implemented by researchers at [Boston University](https://multiparty.org). It has a central server that hosts a client interface and routes messages between individual client parties. It implements an information-theoretically secure, LSSS-based protocol for an arbitrary number of parties. 

The developers have yet to release a paper documenting JIFF.

## Usability
Pretty good, honestly.
